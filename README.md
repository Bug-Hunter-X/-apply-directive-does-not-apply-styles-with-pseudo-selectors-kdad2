This repository demonstrates a bug in Tailwind CSS where the `@apply` directive fails to apply styles when used with utility classes containing pseudo-selectors such as `:hover` or `:focus`.  The bug is reproduced in `bug.css` and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.css`.  The solution involves separating the base styles from the pseudo-selector styles and applying them separately.
